# ATS-CodeBook

This repository contains coding examples of all sorts
written in ATS and possibly other programming languages.
These examples are primarily meant as recipes for people
interested in learning ATS as well as using it to construct
software for use in the real world.

At this point, I no longer have a plan to continue working on the
CodeBook for ATS-Postiats. Instead, I have decided to concentrate my
effort on writing one for ATS-Temptory.  For more information, please
visit [here](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Temptory/tree/master/docgen/CodeBook).


## [ATS-CodeBook/RECIPE](./RECIPE)

Please find various coding examples in this directory.

## [ATS-CodeBook/PLAYGROUND](./PLAYGROUND)

This directory is mostly for playing with some programming ideas of
interest.
