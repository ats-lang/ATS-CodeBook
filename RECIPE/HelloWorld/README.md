# Hello, World!

I suppose that you have already
gained access to the commands patscc, patsopt
and myatscc. If you have not, there are plenty
of resources on-line that can guide you through
the process of installing ATS (more precisely, ATS2)
on your own machine. For instance, you can find various
scripts [on-line](http://www.ats-lang.org/Downloads.html#Scripts_for_installing_ATS_Postiats)
for installing ATS on Linux and MacOS.


```ats
#include "share/atspre_staload.hats"
#include "share/atspre_staload_libats_ML.hats"
