# Hangman (3)

If you have not yet read [Hangman](./Hangman), please
do so first.

This example gives an implementation of the Hangman game for two
independent players, who communicate with each other through two
untyped uni-directional channels. The difficulty in programming with
such untyped channels naturally motivates the needed for typed
channels where the types classifying channels are often referred to as
session types.

Happy programming in ATS!!!
