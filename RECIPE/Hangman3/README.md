# Hangman (3)

If you have not yet read [Hangman](./Hangman), please
do so first.

This example gives an implementation of the Hangman game
that is genuinely distributed. The channels used in the
implementation are untyped, and the difficulty in programming
with untyped channels naturally motives the needed for typed
channels where the types are often referred to as session types.

Happy programming in ATS!!!
