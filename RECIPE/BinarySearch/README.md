# Binary Search

The program in this example demonstrates a stream-based approach to
locating a zero of a given continuous function in a given interval via
the so-called binary search. Unlike Newton-Raphson's method, binary
search does not need the derivative of the given function, though its
convergence rate is (much) slower than that of Newton-Raphson's method.

Happy programming in ATS!!!
