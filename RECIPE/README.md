# Coding Examples in ATS

## [Hello](./Hello)

This example shows how to construct a simple program in ATS, compile
it and then execute it.
  
## [ReadFromSTDIN](./ReadFromSTDIN)

This example demonstrates a stream-based approach to constructing an
interactive program that handles input from the user.

## [ReadFromSTDIN2](./ReadFromSTDIN2)

This example is meant to be directly compared with
[ReadFromSTDIN](./ReadFromSTDIN). While the code in this one does
essentially the same as that of [ReadFromSTDIN](./ReadFromSTDIN), it
is written is a different style, which greatly stresses the use of
combinators in functional programming.

## [WordFreqCount](./WordFreqCount)
