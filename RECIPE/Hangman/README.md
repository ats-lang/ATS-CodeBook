# Hangman

Hangman is a simple word-guessing game.  The program chooses a word in
some random fashion and then gives the player a fixed number of
chances to guess the word. The player can guess one letter each time;
if the letter does not appear in the word, then the player loses a
chance; otherwise, each occurrence of the letter is displayed and the
player do not lose a chance. The player loses if all of the given
chances are used up, or the player wins after all of the letters in
the word are correctly guessed.

Happy programming in ATS!!!
